# How I made this website

This site has been made with Cursor, some [jules.google.com](https://jules.google.com/) and love ❤️. Because [why not](https://x.com/emilesilvis/status/1929813972879847583)?

It consists only of a `template.html` file, a `build.py` script and two Python dependencies (`markdown` and `Pygments` for code highlighting). [Check it out](https://github.com/emilesilvis/emilesilvis.github.io).
